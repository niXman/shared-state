# shared-state
Test task for implementing multithreaded Shared-State server using asio

# Update Nov 30, 2023
The company refused me because of bugs... It's OK, bugs can be everywhere, because programmers are people too =)

I'm curious and trying to understand what these bugs are...

Another surprising thing:
- It turns out that this test was NOT for proficiency in ASIO, but for the ability to write without bugs?
- Or was it a test of tester skills?
- Or was it a test of the desire to not only write a server for free and spend 9 hours on it, but also spend time on full testing for free? Moreover, in the accompanying note I indicated that there may be bugs because full testing was not carried out!
- Or did the company need someone to implement this task for free?

This all looks very strange...
